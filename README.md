# Maze-Pathfinding-Simulation-Dijkstra-A-Bellman-Ford
Developed a Python-based simulation that visualizes and compares popular pathfinding algorithms — Dijkstra’s, A*, and Bellman-Ford — in a randomly generated 10×10 maze.  • Built using NetworkX, NumPy, and Matplotlib • Converted grid-based mazes into directed graphs for traversal
